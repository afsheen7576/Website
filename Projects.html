        <h3>AirPort Management System Implementation</h3>
        The schemes of Object Oriented Programming were used to implement the AirPort management system. This system was able to book flights, show plane navigation path and the seat allotment. All of these features were defined on the single click too.

        <h3>RoundRobin Time Complexity Calculation</h3>
        Round Robin CPU Algorithm generally focuses on Time Sharing technique. The period of time for which a process or job is allowed to run in a pre-emptive method is called time quantum. Each process or job present in the ready queue is assigned the CPU for
        that time quantum, if the execution of the process is completed during that time then the process will end else the process will go back to the waiting table and wait for the its next turn to complete the execution.

        <h3>School Management System</h3>
        This is a software Design and Analysis project. The school management system (software) has a wide range of features, from applications and class enrollment to detailed performance tracking and financials. Administration management is usually done by
        both faculty and students. This school management system project report discusses its documentation, like the project abstract, modules, proposals, diagram, source codes, and more.
